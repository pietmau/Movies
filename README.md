##TODO
- Externalize api key
- Apparently the MovieDatabase API does not support image size :-(
- Animate favourite
- Could have used data binding, but didn't
- Could have used constraint layout, but didn't

##Features
- Kotlin
- Dagger, RxJava, Architecture components (ViewModel, Room, Paging)
- Repository pattern implementation (DetailRepositoryRetrofit)
- **Api paging** implementation (using Architecture Components)
- Use ViewModel to keep presenters across config changes so that we do not needlessly redo
network requests.
